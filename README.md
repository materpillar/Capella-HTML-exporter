# Capella model HTML exporter

A container image that allows automated exports of Capella models to HTML. The
image can be used for other commandline operations with Capella.

It is especially useful when integrating it into a CI that is connected to the
Git repository where you store your Capella model.

## Build

```bash
docker build -t capella-html-exporter .
```

## Use

By default, the container starts in the `/workdir` folder and executes
`./entrypoint.sh` at startup.

Map the folder where your model and your `entrypoint.sh` is located into the
`/workdir` folder of the container when running the image:

```
ðŸ“¦Capella-HTML-exporter
 â”— ðŸ“‚workdir
   â”£ ðŸ“‚In-Flight Entertainment System
   â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ.project
   â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œIn-Flight Entertainment System.afm
   â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œIn-Flight Entertainment System.aird
   â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œIn-Flight Entertainment System.capella
   â”— ðŸ“œentrypoint.sh
```

```bash
docker run --init -v `pwd`/workdir:/workdir capella-html-exporter
```

### Entrypoint.sh

You must run Capella in a virtual framebuffer as it requires a X server.
`Xvfb` is included in the docker image.

The manual for the Capella XHTML Document Generator plugin describes that
the import of the project into the workspace and the document generation can be
performed in one command ("Import Capella project and generate inside it")  
Yet, it seems that Capella 1.4.2, 5.0.0, 5.1.0 and 5.2.0 have a bug in the
`org.polarsys.kitalpha.doc.gen.business.capella.commandline` function that will
lead to the project being imported, but no HTML generation being done.
Therefore, we use the `validation` app first to import the project into the
Capella workspace and do the XHTML generation in a second command without the
import.

The `entrypoint.sh` could look like this:

```bash
# Import the project into the workspace and validate it
xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 1280x720x24" \
capella -nosplash -consoleLog \
-application org.polarsys.capella.core.commandline.core \
-appid org.polarsys.capella.core.validation.commandline \
-data /workspace \
-import "/workdir/In-Flight Entertainment System" \
-input "/In-Flight Entertainment System/In-Flight Entertainment System.aird" \
-outputfolder "/In-Flight Entertainment System/validation" \
-logfile /workdir/log.html \
-forceoutputfoldercreation

# Export the model as HTML
# Note: It seems that Capella has a bug in this function that does not allow
# to use the import flag here.
xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 1280x720x24" \
capella -nosplash -consoleLog \
-application org.polarsys.capella.core.commandline.core \
-appid org.polarsys.kitalpha.doc.gen.business.capella.commandline \
-data /workspace \
-input "/In-Flight Entertainment System/In-Flight Entertainment System.aird" \
-outputfolder "/In-Flight Entertainment System/html_export" \
-logfile /workdir/log.html \
-forceoutputfoldercreation
```
